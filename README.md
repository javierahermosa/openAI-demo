## OpenAI API Demo Application
This is the basic skeleton of a Flask application that takes a couple of text values as input 
and returns an output value, which is also text.

The base.html file contains the basic structure of the web page. This 
can include the header, css definitions, footer, etc. Using this base.html 
as a template, other pages can be created that inherit the basic structure. 
The templates are created using Jinja.
